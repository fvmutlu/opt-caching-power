Simulation code used in joint power and caching optimization

## Conventions
### File Names
* **Functions:** Files that have their entire code encapsulated in a function block are given the same name as the function that's defined within the file.

                function [outparams] = functionName (inparams)
                    % function code
                end

* **Scripts:** Files that are not in function form and are used to produce simulation runs are named with a preceding **s_**.
               These are referred to as scripts.
